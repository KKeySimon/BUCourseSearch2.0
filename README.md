# BUCourseSearch2.0

This project looks to implement many of the features lacking in BU's course search.
This mainly comes in form of filters that will be added such as
- Minimum RateMyProfessor score
- Whether or not class is full
- Conflicts with current course schedule

For Project Members:
run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" for development

TODO:
- [ ] Implement all filters
- [ ] Set default value of instructorDiff when webscraping to above 5 if RMP page doesn't exist for this person
- [ ] Put everything other than Keyword under Additional Search Options
- [ ] Add schedule/checkmark related filters
